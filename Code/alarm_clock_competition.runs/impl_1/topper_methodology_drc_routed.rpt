LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state_machine/Q[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) WM_count/Q_reg[0]/CLR, WM_count/Q_reg[1]/CLR, WM_count/Q_reg[2]/CLR, WM_count/Q_reg[3]/CLR, WM_count/Thresh_reg/CLR, WM_count/tracker_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Warning
